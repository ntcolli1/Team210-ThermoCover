This is the README file for the Thermo Mask.

The Thermo Mask is a  wearable mask, with added features that will improve usersâ€™ experiences and comfort such as a thermometer, a power pressure sensor, and an LED display that can display a users' current health. The pressure sensor will act as the power button where once it senses the user it will turn on. The temperature sensor will then gather data about the user's temperature and send that data through wifi communication to their device, once it reaches the device the user will have the option to display their temperature on their mask using the LED display.
